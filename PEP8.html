    <p class="smallnormaltext">What is PEP? Well, PEP stands for "Python Enhancement Proposals." What all that means is
      that this is how you should format your code. It will amke it easier to read, and for other coders to review and
      understand. Some companies will not even hire you if you do not follow these guidlines. These are important
      because code is written once, but read far more. This is why it is important to improve the readability of your
      code.

  <p class="smallnormaltext"><span class='tab'></span>1. When applying the guideline would make the code less readable,
    even for someone who is
    used to reading code that follows this PEP.<br><span class='tab'></span>2. To be consistent with surrounding code
    that also breaks it (maybe
    for historic reasons) – although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else’s mess (in true XP style).
    Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying
    that code.<br><span class='tab'></span>3. When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python
    that don’t support the
    feature recommended by the style guide.</p>
